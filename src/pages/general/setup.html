    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>AnywhereFlex is a CSS utility library featuring various helpers such as a grid system, flexbox, spacing,
        elevation
        and more.</p>

    <h5>Module Loader</h5>
    <p>AnywhereFlex is available for download at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/anywhere-flex">NPM</a> for usage
        with a
        module bundler such as webpack.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-markup">
npm install anywhere-flex --save

</code></pre>

    <p>After installation you may include the library by importing from node_modules.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-markup">
/node_modules/anywhere-flex/anywhere-flex.css
    
</code></pre>

    <h5>Load from CDN</h5>
    <p>AnywhereFlex can also be loaded from a CDN using a link tag.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/anywhere-flex@1.0.0/anywhere-flex.css"&gt;
            
</code></pre>

    <h5>Themes</h5>
    <p>AnywhereFlex does not ship with a built-in color scheme by default as it is derived from the Anywhere UI library.
        In
        case you need to use it standalone without a Anywhere library, include one of the themes from the themes folder.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/anywhere-flex@1.0.0/themes/any-blue.css"&gt;
<!-- &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/anywhere-flex@1.0.0/themes/arya-blue.css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/anywhere-flex@1.0.0/themes/vela-blue.css"&gt; -->
</code></pre>

    <h5>Variables</h5>
    <p>SASS variables are available to customize and create your own anywhere-flex build. To begin with clone the <a
            href="https://github.com/adaleks/anywhere-flex">anywhere-flex repo</a> and then build the anywhere-flex.scss
        file
        after your customizations. Refer to <a href="https://sass-lang.com/install">Sass</a> documentation for more
        information about how to build scss files.</p>

                <td>:</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h5>Reuse Classes</h5>
    <p>Commonly used class blocks can be merged as a single class to be reused using the <i>styleclass</i> mixin. Import
        the utils from <i>anywhere-flex/utils</i> to be able to create your own classes based on AnywhereFlex classes.
        Here
        is
        how to create a class called <i>mybutton</i>
        with the built-in features.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-css">
@import 'anywhere-flex/anywhere-flex.scss';

.mybutton {
    @include styleclass('bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600 border-round transition-colors transition-duration-150 p-3 border-none');
}

</code></pre>

    <p>If the import does not work, update your build configuration to import from node_modules or explicitly use the
        relative path e.g. <i>../node_modules/anywhere-flex/anywhere-flex.scss</i>.</p>

    <pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;button type="button" class="mybutton"&gt;My Button&lt;/button&gt;

</code></pre>

    <h5>Production Size</h5>
    <p>When using a utility CSS library like AnywhereFlex, it is likely to use only a set of classes from the library
        leaving the rest of the library as unused. To avoid including the unused part from your application, it is
        strongly recommended to use a tool like <a href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</a>
        that analyzes your code and generates an optimized anywhere-flex file that only contains the utilities you've
        used.
    </p>
